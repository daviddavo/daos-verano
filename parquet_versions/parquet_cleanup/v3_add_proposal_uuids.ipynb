       "\n",
       "ETHWaterloo will take place on 8-10 Nov. About 500 conference attendees and **400 hackers, **with some high profile people including Vitalik. The dHack will hold about $10,000, $5,000 from ETHGlobal and potentially $5,000 from Genesis via this proposal.\n",
       "\n",
       "ETHBerlin, the previous dHack, was a big milestone and learning opportunity for dHack. [You can read the summary here](https://daotalk.org/t/dhack-pilot-summary-part-1-what-we-did/840).  \\\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "We learned critical lessons for onboarding, user behavior, and better suited parameters for upcoming implementations. We saw what a DAO looks at a ‘concentrated’ scale, from metrics (45k GEN locked), behaviors like stake wars (sorry Grace) and substantial social media interest in dHack and DAOStack. dHack also funded interesting DAOstack related projects like [MyDAODashboard](https://www.mydaodashboard.com), and the [first concept of a social DAO app](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x0c88aa3c4fe9f9f8da766e9b8bfbbaa1235928cc/proposal/0xa45e142ad69a0be50c83fc813b9971823b641072e4557988607b00b8b7ae1bfb). \n",
       "\n",
       "**What we lacked was the conversion from dHack participant, someone who has gone through and learned how to use Alchemy, into a Genesis DAO member. **Scroll down, your help is needed here****\n",

       "\n",
       "### **ETHGlobal dHack - Why is this important**\n",

       "ETHWaterloo was the first ETHGlobal hackathon and [where it all started](https://twitter.com/ethwaterloo2/status/1166766745224269824), which makes it fitting to start the next iteration of hackathons with an ongoing dHack DAO. \n",
       "\n",
       "The performance, engagement, and activity of dHack in ETHWaterloo will decide whether ETHGlobal will continue with dHack into 2020, running a dHack in all of their events.
